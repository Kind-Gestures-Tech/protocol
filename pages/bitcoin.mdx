# Kind Health Tech Token on Bitcoin Ordinals Testnet

## Overview

The Kind Health Tech Token (KHT), under the ticker KIND, is being tested on the Bitcoin Ordinals testnet using the Ordinals protocol philosophy. You can access the testnet [here](https://testnet.unisat.io/brc20/KIND). This allows KHT holders to mint tokens and conduct transactions using the KIND ticker, adhering to the BRC-20 standard.

## BRC-20 Standard

The BRC-20 standard is used to facilitate transactions for KIND tokens on the Bitcoin network. Below is an example of the deployment schema used:

```json
{
  "p": "brc-20",
  "op": "deploy",
  "tick": "KIND",
  "max": "21000000",
  "lim": "1000000"
}
```

## Details

Ticker: KIND
Maximum Supply: 21,000,000 KIND
Mint Limit: 1,000,000 KIND per mint operation

## Philosophy of Bitcoin Ordinals

The Bitcoin Ordinals protocol provides a decentralized way to inscribe digital artifacts on the blockchain. The KIND tokens follow the philosophy of Ordinals by:

- Self-Issuance: Allowing public minting of tokens.
- Transparency: Making all transactions and inscriptions traceable and auditable.
- Interoperability: Enabling cross-chain compatibility between Bitcoin and other networks.

## Migration to 5-Byte Standard

Currently, KIND uses the 4-byte standard. In the production phase, we will migrate to a 5-byte standard to ensure scalability and adaptability. This will enable the public to issue tokens and ensure only authorized participants can mint them.
