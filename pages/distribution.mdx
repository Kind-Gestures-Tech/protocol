# Token Distribution

## Distribution Philosophy

The distribution of Kind Health Tech Tokens (KHT) follows a simple yet strategic approach to ensure that the founders and key team members are rewarded proportionally based on their contributions. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Token Allocation**:

   - An initial set of tokens is pre-allocated and reserved specifically for the project's founders.
   - These tokens can only be claimed after a year (365 days) and are designed to encourage sustained commitment to the project.

2. **Founders & Team Members' Role**:

   - Each founder is encouraged to work collaboratively with team members.
   - If no team members are involved within a year, the project will be shut down as the founders need team support to ensure success.
   - A public vote will be organized to assess the quantifiable tasks completed by each founder and their team.

3. **Task-Based Evaluation & Voting**:

   - Each task will be quantifiable, such as actual sales, code contributions, or data analysis.
   - The results of the public vote will be randomized and submitted to an Ethereum/Off Chain contract, which will handle computation.

4. **Computation and Minting**:
   - The computation can be done offline, but will be activated after the 365th day, enabling the founders to claim or mint a percentage of tokens based on their contributions.
   - The minting process will distribute tokens proportionally to the founders according to the computed percentage.

## Summary

This distribution model is designed to reward genuine effort while providing transparency. By involving the community in voting, each participantâ€™s contribution can be measured and rewarded fairly.

### How to Participate

1. **Team Members**: Join the team and contribute towards measurable milestones.
2. **Public Voting**: Stay involved in public voting to help shape the future of the project.
